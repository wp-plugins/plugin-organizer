== Description ==

This plugin allows you to do the following:
1. Change the order that your plugins are loaded.
2. Selectively disable plugins by any post type or wordpress managed URL.
3. Adds grouping to the plugin admin age.

== Installation ==

1. Extract the downloaded Zip file.
2. Upload the 'plugin-organizer' directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Use the menu item under settings in the WordPress admin called Plugin Organizer to get the plugin set up.

IMPORTANT: To enable selective plugin loading you must move the /wp-content/plugins/plugin-organizer/lib/PluginOrganizerMU.class.php file to /wp-content/mu-plugins or wherever your mu-plugins folder is located.  If the mu-plugins directory does not exist you can create it.  The plugin will attempt to create this directory and move the file itself when activated.  Depending on your file permissions it may not be successful.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==
Q. How do I enable the selective plugin loading functionality?

A. Go to the Plugin Organizer settings page and check the enable radio button under selective plugin loading.  Then visit your homepage.  Finally return to the Plugin Organizer settings page and see if the enable radio button is still checked.  If it is not then you are running an old version of the MU component.  Copy the PluginOrganizerMU.class.php file to the mu-plugins folder then deactivate and reactivate the plugin.  Repeat these steps to ensure that the plugin is working.  Remember that you will need to update the PluginOrganizerMU.class.php file whenever the plugin is updated and check your settings afterward.

Q. Does this plugin work with wordpress multi-site?

A. Yes it has been tested on several multi-site installs.  Both subdomain and sub folder types.

Q. Does this plugin work with custom post types?

A. Yes it has been tested with custom post types.  You can add support for your custom post types on the settings page.

Q. Does this only apply to WP MU or all types of WP installs?
"IMPORTANT: To enable selective plugin loading you must move the /wp-content/plugins/plugin-organizer/lib/PluginOrganizerMU.class.php file to /wp-content/mu-plugins or wherever your mu-plugins folder is located. If the mu-plugins directory does not exist you can create it.  The plugin will attempt to create this directory and move the file itself when activated.  Depending on your file permissions it may not be successful."

A. The mu-plugins folder contains "Must Use" plugins that are loaded before regular plugins. The mu is not related to WordPress MU. This was added to regular WordPress in 3.0 I believe. I only placed this one class in the MU folder because I wanted to have my plugin run as a normal plugin so it could be disabled if needed. 


Q. In what instance would this plugin be useful?

A. 
  Example 1: If you have a large number of plugins and don't want them all to load for every page you can disable the unneeded plugins for each individual page.  Or you can globally disable them and enable them for each post or page you will need them on.
  Example 2: If you have plugins that conflict with eachother then you can disable the plugins that are conflicting for each indivdual post or page.
  Example 3: If you have plugins that conflict with eachother then you can disable the plugins globally and activate them only on posts or pages where they will be used.
